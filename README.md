# DPCM
Implement the image compression by DPCM (differential pulse code modulation) encoding.

## v1.0

- Supports 8-bit quantisation

## v1.0.1

- Improves quantiser

## v2.0

- Supports 1 to 8-bit quantisation
- Can compute the PMF (probability mass function) and entropy of the original and reconstructed image

## v2.0.1

- Functions simplified

## v2.1

- Can compute the PSNR (peak signal to noise ratio) of the reconstructed image

- Adds necessary comments

## v2.1.1

- Bug fixes of PSNR
